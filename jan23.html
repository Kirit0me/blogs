            I think I like my heading as I use it a lot. In a lot of situations. When I am confused and don't wanna ask back what that meant,
            I just say it. Anyways, I am kiritome and I am right now in the process of exploring what I want to do in my life. This blog could
            be a landmark of some sorts, as I am just going to write down what I think/feel at this point(although I don't really feel much).
            To be honest, I wanted to host a webpage and found this so I am trying it.

            I really want to write down solidly about my "romantic" feelings at this moment. It's not like I want to date, but it's also like I
            don't want to put efforts into it, not that I know much about what sort of efforts I would put.

            Nextly, I want to write about some of the things I want to do in future. I really want to get good at C++ and coding in general,
            Also I want to get good at CTF and participate in some of the competitions. I will, atleast this time, try to put constant efforts
            cause, I really haven't been able to follow through, or grind anything productive till now in my life. 
            <br>
            All I could get good was to watch anime, play rpg games,read novels, playing anime openings badly on piano and catfish on discord(which I have now left)
            All of it which came from the grind, so I will try implying that to productive things so I can get good at something productive.

            Ahh, I really dont want to put this out, but I will, I suppose.
