    Isekais are not so bad, Not soo ba-add
    </h1>
    <p class = "text-white">
        So I haven't been able to watch a lot of anime recently, but I want to talk about isekai today. Yes isekai. I love isekai animes because they have
        this adventure element in them and the good ones really come up with concepts of power systems. I would say that nowadays the genre is getting diluted
        like there is Farming life in another world, a couple of slime animes or just some straight out copies and cringe shows in isekai but, the good ones
        are still pretty good and relevant.
        <br>
        I really liked <b>Kenja no Mago</b>back in the days and I rewatched it pretty recently and still like it. I think its a controversial opinion but the type of genericity in this is good. 
        I also sometimes don't understand the opinion of people calling things copied or too generic... Like its natural man, even we watch the same show many times. Shows being bad have nothing
        to do with them being copied.
        <br> 
        Putting that aside, <b>Konosuba</b> is definetely one of the most comedic isekais I have seen. I have read ahead a bit and it never fails to get a laugh out of me with its gag jokes. Although
        the story progression can be slow, like the reverse isekai "McD Demon Lord" but that gets pretty serious quickly when it has to.
        <br>
        Animes like <b>Gate Jietai</b> and <b>Outbreak Comapny</b> where its not technically not an isekai but like a completely new world opened in front of them and the can use a "gate" like thing to travel 
        between them. Like even in <b>World Trigger</b>and stuff. They were interesting animes. I like Outbreak Company's light novel too, there is quite a lot of content too for it.
        <br>
        Speaking about the actual good isekai animes, I would say <b>Realist Hero, Mushoku Tensei, Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken, Shield Hero and Didnt I tell to make my abilities average in Neext life.</b>
        As you can see from the last one, I just love All female animes.I love yuri too. And this is gonna be the topic of discussion in the next blog.
