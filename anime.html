        <h1>anime is cartoon</h1>
        <p> 
            Honestly, a lot of cartoons aren't for children(Inside Job, Bojack Horseman, Simpsons, Family Guy) and some cartoons are truly fun(Phineas&Ferb, 
            Oggy and the Cockroaches, Tom & Jerry, Ben 10 and so many more!)<br>
            And it is a fact that anime is basically is an art style in which these series are made which have originated from Japan, never got the point of view of people who hate anime being called cartoon or for kids, 
            because some animes are definetely for kids and some cartoons are heavy.<br>

            Anyways I will branch out from here talking about various genres here, as I watch a lot.
