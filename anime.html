        Anime is Cartoon
    </h1>
    <main>
        Honestly, a lot of cartoons aren't for children(Inside Job, Bojack Horseman, Simpsons, Family Guy) and some
        cartoons are truly fun(Phineas&Ferb,
        Oggy and the Cockroaches, Tom & Jerry, Ben 10 and so many more!)<br><br>
        And it is a fact that anime is basically is an art style in which these series are made which have originated
        from Japan, never got the point of view of people who hate anime being called cartoon or for kids,
        because some animes are definetely for kids and some cartoons are heavy.<br><br>

        Anyways I will branch out from here talking about various genres here, as I watch a lot. But today mostly I want
        to talk about <b class="text-red-500">Koe de Oshigoto.</b>
        Just amazing two episodes. I really want to watch more animes like it. It is basically about eroge voice acting.
        I highly recommend to my fellow degenerates to watch it.
        I am watching Seiyuu Girl and REC becuase of that.
        <br>
        <br>
        The only other anme I watched which was based on voice acting was GIRLISH NUMBER. That one is also pretty good.
        It's where the
        little sister is actually the main character named Chitose and her brother helps her rise in the industry. At
        first you find her repelling due to her lack of will to work and improve
        but she has great character development and I personally liked it.
        <br><br>
        There are other animes like Shirobako which are based on the anime industry itself as a whole. The main
        character is a rookie in the producer team in the Musashino Studio. It gives
        good insight on the anime industry and how they work, or atleast the way they have presented the industry looks
        pretty realistic with some obvious exaggerations. There is a subplot for all
        things required in anime, Art, Animation, Voice Acting, Plot development, Storyboard making, Fact checking, 3DCG
        etc.
        <br>
        <br>
        While writing this blog, I realised that nowadays a lot of people write blogs on anime and explain the synopsis
        of them pretty well.
        So I have decided to take advantage of the ability I have, that is to keep watching a lot of anime. And then
        recommending you all animes based on qualities of anime which you like of.
        <br>

        Although I find Koe de Oshigoto unique in what it has done (eroge voice acting) but if you plainly liked Koe de
        Oshigoto for its voice acting element then u can watch :
