        <h1 class = "text-4xl p-6 text-center font-extrabold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-tr from-purple-700 to-green-300">Anime is Cartoon</h1>
        <p class = "text-xl text-transparent bg-clip-text text-white p-8 pr-8">  
            Honestly, a lot of cartoons aren't for children(Inside Job, Bojack Horseman, Simpsons, Family Guy) and some cartoons are truly fun(Phineas&Ferb, 
            Oggy and the Cockroaches, Tom & Jerry, Ben 10 and so many more!)<br>
            And it is a fact that anime is basically is an art style in which these series are made which have originated from Japan, never got the point of view of people who hate anime being called cartoon or for kids, 
            because some animes are definetely for kids and some cartoons are heavy.<br>

            Anyways I will branch out from here talking about various genres here, as I watch a lot. But today mostly I want to talk about <b class = "text-red-500">Koe de Oshigoto.</b>  
            Just amazing two episodes. I really want to watch more animes like it. It is basically about eroge voiice acting. I highly recommend to my fellow degenerates to watch it.
