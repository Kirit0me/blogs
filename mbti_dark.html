        Many of you would've clicked here would be elitist ready to judge how I explain this topic, and some would've
        just clicked out of
        interest. To those interested in this topic, please don't do the 16personalities test on the "official site",
        pls and ty.
        <br><br>
        Now that out of the way, there are 16 personality types according to the Myers-Briggers-Type-Indiactor. But
        mostly I want to
        focus on the part of cognitive functions here, as they are the things that helped me understand humans a little
        better. I
        became less angry, and a little bit more observant towards people who I couldn't gel with.
        People are all different and it's not their fault that my social skills are lacking.
