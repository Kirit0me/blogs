            I am finally touching html in a while, (after 2 months). But it feels fine. Mostly because there is nothing to really learn in this language. Anyways since the last time I wrote
            on this page, I have definetely grown and that's what I have come to record here. My original goal of getting better at C++ hasn't changed, in fact I finally made a ray tracing 
            project and have it uploaded on my github.<br>
            I have done a few other things too and uploaded them there, like discord bot and advent of code and bandit-overthewire solutions. I did learn a lot in a short period of time
            but I burnout pretty fast. It was like a month and a half of getting into computer science completely. I recently had exams so I didn't really do anything else except read some manga
            and keep up with the latest animes.<br>
            I went out quite a bit too. A few concerts here and there, a few movies here and there. I will be releasing more of anime thoughts soon, mostly based on music animes, as I haven't seeen
            one in a while, and there's <b>Kizune Ai's anime</b> and <b>Ao no Orchestra</b> releasing.<br>
            Lastly, I have finally realised that I have been feeling incomplete. Whenever something goes wrong, I have PTSD of past incidents, even though I thought I was good at moving on from things.
            I will work on this issue of mine, and try enjoying life to the fullest. School's PTSD is real, and I know things are a lot different now.
