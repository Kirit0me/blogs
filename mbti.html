            Through the eyes of an ISTP
        </h1>

        <p> 
            Many of you would've clicked here would be elitist rready to judge how I explain this topic, and some would've just clicked out
            interest. To those interested in this topic, please don't do the 16personalities test on the "official site", pls and ty.
            <br>
            Now that out of the way, there are 16 personality types according to the Myers-Briggers-Type-Indiactor. But mostly I want to 
            focus on the part of cognitive functions here, as they are the things that helped me understand humans a little better. I 
            became less angry, and a little bit more observant towards people who I couldn't gel with. 
            People are all different and it's not their fault that my social skills are lacking. 
            
            <hr>
            <h2>
            So there are 8 cognitive functions, (I will be describing how their dominants would be like, Photo of all the combinations below):
            </h2>
            <b>Ti - Introverted thinking</b> : Logical minds, they try to make sense of whatever situations are posed to them, <b>internally</b>. They might be the most introverted of all, as they value their private space and love thinking about things around them all the time. <br>
            <b>Te - Extroverted thinking</b> : Understanding the external world as is and <b> actively particpating </b> in setting it up. They usually are great leaders as they have a great idea of people's values and how they can work better.<br>
            <b>Fi - Introverted feeling</b> : They value their own personal ethics and morales a lot. They usually don't give a fuck about the how the world thinks of them. They are prone to depression due to overthinking about their "genuine" feelings.<br>
            <b>Fe - Extroverted feeling</b> : They are the nicest people. <b>Majoritarians</b> as I would like to call them. They will not be involved in any sort of politically incorrect debates and can;t crack good jokes.<br>
            <b>Si - Introverted Sensing</b> : They value traditions a lot. They <b>hate experimenting</b> and want to follow an already laid out path which is smooth and well cemented. They are usually well organised and clean.<br>
            <b>Se - Extroverted Sensing</b> : They sort of live in the moment. Don't value traditions at all and have a strong will of carving out their own path. <b>Carpe Diem</b><br>
            <b>Ni - Introverted Intuition</b> : Honestly, their minds work in a complex way, forming patterns and are sometimes hard to differentiate from Ti. But you would see them always observant of their environment and forming connections, unlike Ti who are usually lost in their own world. They are also the best <b>planners</b>, evaluating every possible situation they can think of. Due to this they are usually pessimistic.<br>
            <b>Ne - Extroverted Intuition</b> : They are always brimming with new ideas, and are great stimuli for creative changes in society. They are always <b>energetic</b> for complex discussions and are great joke crackers.<br>
            <hr>
            I will be talking more deeply about personality types later. I just want to include the axes here :<br>
            <b>Ti-Fe, Ne-Si, Ni-Se, Te-Fi</b> are the four axes, meaning a person with Ti will have also Fe and so on. <br>
            Try thinking about the reasons why this is the case and have fun "judging" people!
