        Introverted Thinking 
    </h1>
    <p class="p-6 text-xl text-white">
        As a dominant user of Ti function, I thought about talking of everything I think I know about this function. Stereotypically they are
        known as the smartest people, or people with a higher average IQ. They are known as logical beings and happen to be pretty insocial most
        of the time. This is mostly due to the fact that they are constantly thinking. I have usually noticed that in every situation I am, I am 
        akways analysing what to say next, do next. And this feels natural. And to be honest, this is obvious, I mean evDifferentiateryone does that. 
        But something about dominant Ti users is special. It's that they prioritise this activity over anything. 
        <br>
        As a result, Ti users are not that reactive. Which adds on to their Ti-Fe axis. But nevertheless, Ti users are usually blunt and hate
        ignorant people. <b class = "text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-tr from-purple-700 to-green-300">INTPs and ISTPs</b>
        are dominant Ti users. Differentiating between these two could be quite a task sometimes, but I hate to say it that INTPs are more fun 
        and are better at cracking jokes. ISTPs are very hands on and just want to be left in peace to do work. In my experience, I have found
        it really hard learning anything properly by just reading it out. Usually in school and even in Universities, you have to be just reading 
        textbooks and understanding concepts that way to learn. But I find it more and more difficult to do so as time progresses. I like to actually
        experience what I have learnt. For example, because I drive a car, I am able to completely understand and remember how gear drives work. 
        <br>
        I am usually most uncomfortable when I am at the centre of spotlight. So I try as hard as I can to stay invisible to other people. A lot of 
        introverts hate being crowds and say it drains their energy. But I like losing energy sometimes and like blending in the crowd. It's fun.
